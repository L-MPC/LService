<b>About :</b>
<br>The LService is a simplified chat system service using ToxCore library for secure communications 
and can be used by other applications via intercoms or any other internal or external coms way,
that's why it doesn't have a user interface.
It can be used as a wrapper of ToxCore library for the very and most basic functions for 
a secure chat system in windows operating systems by any application.
It is running stable in windows systems and is hidden but visible through the system processes.
It can be easy become a native windows service too instead of running as hidden executable service.
This service is under GPL3 license since it makes use of ToxCore library for windows which is under the same License.
